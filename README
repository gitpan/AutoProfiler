The AutoProfiler module is completely automatic in its basic mode.
You simply "use" the module at the top of you main script.
The module will then automatically instrument all subroutines
in the code, profile each subroutine call during the execution
of the script, and print out a report of usage.

To use the AutoProfiler module in your program, just put 
this one line in your program:

  use AutoProfiler;

everything else will happen automatically.

If you use a module that you do not want profiled, 
"use" that module before you "use" the AutoProfiler module. i.e.

  use DoNotProfile;

  use AutoProfiler;

  use ThisModuleWillGetProfiled;

When the program has completed, the AutoProfiler will automatically
print out information about every subroutine that was profiled.
